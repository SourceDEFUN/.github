# Welcome to SourceDEFUN's main GitHub page!
Here you'll be able to find the source code of the SourceDEFUN itself and the tools we use!

## Update on 25th of August
SourceDEFUN will be revived and under a new name: `DEFUN: REVIVED`. The Source code is compileable on Linux, but not done yet.

## So... What happened?
I've lost all the motivation to keep this project going. Expect no further support from me (Sectonidse). If there would be no changes or pull requests after a year will pass (starting from august 7th), SourceDEFUN will be archived.

## Why did you abandon Alien Swarm SDK?
Because it doesn't support Linux. It is always nice to have compatibility with not only Windows, but also Linux.
