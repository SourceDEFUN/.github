# Welcome to SourceDEFUN's main GitHub page!
Here you'll be able to find the source code of the SourceDEFUN itself and the tools we use!

## TO VALVE: Why are we using leaked version
Because we love Source Engine! And it's quite dissapointing that you haven't released the full SDK yet. We know that you haven't done that so there would be no important info leaks, but i'm pretty sure that none of these infos already matter.

## Differences between SDK and non-commercial versions
SDK is greatly limited in terms of flexibility. Here's what's implemented in non-commercial that's not in SDK:
* Bigger world support (You can basically make a 65536 map in Vanilla Hammer with SDK, but it wouldn't launch without non-commercial)


## Questions and Answers
### Why did you abandon Alien Swarm SDK?
Because it doesn't support Linux. It is always nice to have compatibility with not only Windows, but also Linux.
### Are you using leaked version of Source Engine?
Not really. You can always contribute to the SDK version of SourceDEFUN, however if your contribute is not possible within SDK, fell free to contribute to non-commercial version!
### Can i use the non-commercial version for commercial stuff?
nope. Nobody can, including the owners of the repo.
